# The CSS

HTML5 Boilerplate's CSS includes:

- [style.css](#stylecss)

## style.css

Several base styles are included. These styles:

- provide basic typography settings that improve text readability
- protect against unwanted `text-shadow` during text highlighting
- tweak the default alignment of some elements (e.g.: `img`, `video`,
  `fieldset`, `textarea`)
- style the prompt that is displayed to users using an outdated browser
- and more...

These styles are included in
[style.css](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/main/dist/css/style.css).
